My name is Juliana and I am 17 years old. I enjoy being with my friends and creating memories. I love capturing memories because I like the fact of being able to go back, look at the photos and/or videos and remember everything from that moment. They are like time travel machines.
I've had tacos on the moon and find them far superior to Earth tacos.
